This is Arduino code I am writing as a Research Assistant at the University of Southern Maine. 
It will read data from sensors on an off-shore drifter bouey meant to collect data of Maine waters. 
Sensor reading code has already been estabilished, 
the goal of this code is to conserve power by turning sensors off when not reading data using a relay, 
and putting the Arduino into a low-power sleep mode at the same time.
